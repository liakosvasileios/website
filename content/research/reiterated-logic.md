## Introduction: When Logic Rewrites Itself
What happens when logic becomes the subject of its own operations? In both mathematics and computer science, we encounter systems where rules apply to themselves. Recursive theorems, interpreters written in the languages they interpret, and mutation engines that mutate their own transformation logic. This phenomenon, which we’ll call reiterated logic, forms a core principle of DISARM, a self-adaptive metamorphic engine developed to resist static and symbolic analysis through runtime code mutation.

DISARM doesn’t simply rewrite code, it applies logical transformation rules at runtime, modifying the execution layer dynamically. The system thus doesn’t just operate with logic, but on logic. This makes it a practical implementation of not just reiterated logic, but also reconfigurable logic: a system where the behavior of the computation itself is fluid, context-dependent, and adversarially evasive.

This article explores the theoretical and practical role of reiterated and reconfigurable logic within DISARM, connecting formal logic theory to real-world software mutation strategies.

## 1. Reiterated Logic: A Brief Theoretical Foundation
At its heart, reiterated logic is about logic operating on logic. We see this idea emerge in several foundational domains:
- [Gödel’s incompleteness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) relies on arithmetic encoding statements about arithmetic itself, demonstrating self-reference through a formal system.
- [Lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) introduces fixed-point combinators like the Y-combinator, which allow for recursive function definitions using nothing more than functions themselves.
- In programming, recursive functions and meta-programming techniques let software reason about or transform its own structure.

These examples all involve a system that contains within it the capacity to operate on its own rules or behaviors. Importantly, such logic is often open-ended, reiterative processes can loop or nest indefinitely, constrained only by termination conditions or meta-level guards.

## 2. Reconfigurable Logic: From Circuits to Code
Reconfigurable logic refers to systems whose operational pathways can be restructured during execution. In hardware, this refers to FPGAs, where logic gates can be rewired on the fly. In software, this concept is more abstract, but no less powerful: logic that is reconfigurable can mean:
- The control flow is dynamically rewritten.
- The dispatch mechanism changes per execution.
- The mutation rules themselves evolve over time.

This is distinct from traditional “branching” logic. A reconfigurable logic system changes the shape of computation itself, not just which path is taken through a fixed graph.

## 3. Programming Meets Formal Logic: A Shared Vocabulary
Programming languages have long borrowed from logic. Through concepts like:
- The [Curry–Howard correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence), which equates programs with proofs and types with propositions.
- Dependent types, which encode logical properties in the type system.
- Proof assistants (e.g., [Coq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocq), [Agda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language))), which generate executable code from logical statements.

We now build programs that are logical artifacts and conversely, logic that behaves like programs. This merging of computation and reasoning forms the fertile ground on which systems like DISARM stand.

## 4. DISARM as Reiterated and Reconfigurable Logic
DISARM (Detection Inhibition via Self-Adaptive Runtime Mutation) is a metamorphic engine for the x86-64 architecture that implements runtime logic mutation and JIT-based obfuscation. Its architecture fundamentally embodies both reiterated logic and reconfigurable logic.

#### - Logic Rules That Mutate Logic
DISARM contains a mutation engine that transforms instruction sequences based on a library of semantic-preserving rules. But unlike static obfuscators, these transformations are applied dynamically and can themselves be transformed. 
Each rule is not just applied, it can be composed, wrapped, or altered by higher-order rules, enabling logic that rewrites the transformation logic itself. This is reiterated logic in practice: a logic system whose rules are inputs to further rules.

#### - Compound Instruction Groups
Instruction groups are classified into compound behavior flags (e.g., ADD_SUB_GROUP, XOR_SWAP_TRICK, etc.), allowing multiple equivalent instruction sequences to be recognized as belonging to the same semantic cluster.
These groupings form a logic layer over machine instructions, allowing mutations to maintain intent across diverse syntactic representations.

#### - JIT-Based Dispatch Obfuscation
DISARM obscures its control flow via JIT-constructed dispatch tables, dynamically encoded in XMM/YMM registers. This is a rare example of runtime reconfiguration of execution logic, the engine literally builds its own instruction pointer mappings as it runs.
Since these mappings are opaque to symbolic execution engines and evolve per run, DISARM presents a moving target for analysis.

#### - Recursive Mutation Passes
DISARM supports multi-pass recursive mutation. Instructions can be mutated, and then those mutations can be re-mutated according to a different rule set, even one derived from the current runtime context. This deepens the obfuscation and makes behavioral pattern detection exponentially harder.
Each iteration maintains correctness via runtime checks, but no two executions necessarily produce the same transformed binary code, just semantically equivalent ones.

## 5. Why Reiterated and Reconfigurable Logic Matters
In traditional obfuscation, the emphasis is on surface variation: rename symbols, jumble code blocks, encrypt strings. But DISARM’s strength comes from semantic reconfiguration through logic: it changes how the code computes, not just what it looks like.
From a theoretical perspective, this makes it:
- Undecidable in general, similar to how the halting problem emerges from unrestricted self-reference.
- Resistant to symbolic analysis, since logic paths are generated dynamically.
- Self-adaptive, the system is its own moving optimizer.

In a broader sense, DISARM showcases how ideas from recursive logic, reconfigurable execution, and formal semantics converge to produce a new class of obfuscation tools: not just protectors of code, but metalogical transformers of it.

## Conclusion: A Logical Engine That Mutates Its Logic
DISARM represents more than a metamorphic engine, it is an embodiment of reiterated and reconfigurable logic. It draws from deep roots in formal logic and computational theory to build a practical, runtime system that evades analysis through dynamic self-mutation.

Its logic is fluid, recursive, and adaptable. In this sense, DISARM is not just a tool, but a demonstration of how theory and implementation converge: where logic not only describes computation, but becomes computation that rewrites itself.
