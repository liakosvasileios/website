# Welcome

I'm Vasilis, a low-level security researcher with a focus on malware development, reverse engineering, and creative techniques for evading modern detection systems.

This space documents my personal research, technical breakdowns, and tools I've developed - often focused on pushing the limits of static and dynamic analysis.

### Topics I work on:
- Malware behavior analysis and offensive tooling
- Reverse engineering internals and malware (also obfuscated binaries)
- Runtime code mutation and evasion strategies
- Low-level x86_64 systems 
- Operating systems

#### Most notable project? [DISARM](https://github.com/liakosvasileios/DISARM).
